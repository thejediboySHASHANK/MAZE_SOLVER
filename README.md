## Introduction

Welcome to the Maze Solver AI repository! This project combines two exciting tasks. Task 1 involves creating an AI agent that can navigate mazes and find a path from the start (S) to the goal (G) state using various search algorithms. Task 2 takes this a step further by evaluating the performance of these algorithms on mazes of different sizes and visualizing the results.
